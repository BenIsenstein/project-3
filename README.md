# Introduction - TASKr

Team TYTHON welcomes you to its InceptionU - Project 3 submission... TASKr.

Our team consists of members Art Treleaven (dev), Ben Isenstein (dev), Chloe Silvester (dev), Donna Dempsey (dev), and Tony Enerson (Product Owner / Scrum Master).

THE CHALLENGE :
Household tasks never getting done? Whether forgetting the schedule or not knowing what to do, maintaining a home or managing a few can be challenging, but we have an answer!

OUR SOLUTION :
Now with TASKr, the recurring home management app, your maintenance tasks are only a
click away. Upon creation of an account, you create your digital home with a customizable list of tasks based on industry-recognized standards.
Notifications, lists and calendars are among the views you have to remind yourself of upcoming tasks and weâ€™ll help you keep records once you are finished. We can even assist with finding service providers and tracking your costs, no matter how many homes you manage. 


# Background

The TASKr project began from the same REACT mono-repo structure of Greg Fenton's SUPERHOEROES template.
It is a MERN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, Node.js) application made
of two processes:
   1. an Express "server" providing API support for retrieving and submitting
   data from the backend
   2. a React "client" providing a web-based UI


# Using the online app

TASKr has been deployed to the web using HEROKU, and can be launched using the following URL.
https://taskr-1.herokuapp.com/


# Working with this Codebase
## Starting the Express server

In a command shell (CMD, PowerShell, Terminal, etc.) run the commands:
1. `cd server`
1. `npm install`
1. `npm run start`

The server is now running on port *3000*.

## Starting the React client

In a command shell run the commands:
1. `cd client`
1. `npm install`
1. `npm run start`

Your browser should open to `http://localhost:4444`.  The React development
system is running on port *4444*.

# Using your own MongoDB instance

You can run MongoDB locally on your machine or you can sign up for a no-cost(!)
account at `https://www.mongodb.com/`.

Once you have your MongoDB instance set up, simply edit the login information
that is found in `server/models/db.js` using a locally stored ".env" file to store your unique and confidential connection string.
